Overview
========

Caravel is a template SoC for Google SKY130 free shuttles. The
current SoC architecture is given below.

Datasheet and detailed documentation exist `here <https://caravel-harness.readthedocs.io/>`__

Caravel Architecture
====================

Caravel is composed of three main sub-blocks: *management area*, *storage area*, and *user project area*. 

.. _management-area:

Management Area
--------------

The managment area includes a  `picorv32 <https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32>`__ based SoC that includes a number of periphrals like timers, uart, and gpio. The managemnt area runs firmware that can be used to:

-  Configure User Project I/O pads
-  Observe and control User Project signals (through on-chip logic
   analyzer probes)
-  Control the User Project power supply

For a complete list of the SoC periphrals, check the  `memory map <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/master/verilog/rtl/README>`__

.. _storage-area:

Storage Area
--------------

The storage area is an auxiliary storage space for the managment SoC. It holds two dual port RAM blocks (1KB) generated by 
`OpenRAM <https://github.com/VLSIDA/OpenRAM.git>`__

The storage area is only accessible by the management SoC. 

.. _user-project-area:

User Project Area
--------------

This is the user space. It has a limited silicon area ``2.92mm x 3.52mm`` as well as a fixed number of I/O pads ``38`` and power pads ``4``.
 
The user space has access to the following utilities provided by the management SoC: 
 
- ``38`` IO Ports
- ``128`` Logic analyzer probes
- Wishbone port connection to the management SoC wishbone bus. 


Quick Start for User Projects 
=============================

Your area is the full user space, so feel free to add your
project there or create a differnt macro and harden it seperately then
insert it into the user\_project\_wrapper. 

.. _digital-user-project:

Digital Project
--------------

If you are building a digital project for the user space, check `caravel_user_project <https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project>`__. 

If you will use OpenLANE to harden your design, go through the instructions in this `README <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/master/openlane/README.rst>`__.

.. _analog-user-project:

Analog Project
--------------

If you are building a digital project for the user space, check `caravel_user_project_analog <https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project_analog>`__. 


IMPORTANT
^^^^^^^^^

Please make sure to run ``make compress`` before commiting anything to
your repository. Avoid having 2 versions of the
``gds/user\_project\_wrapper.gds`` one compressed and the
other not compressed.

-  For information on tooling and versioning, please refer to `tool-versioning.rst <./docs/source/tool-versioning.rst>`__.

.. _additional-material:

Additional Material

.. _mpw-two:

MPW Two
--------------

Watch slack space for the coming webinar announcment.

.. _mpw-one:

MPW One
--------------

You can learn more about the caravel chip by watching these video:

-  `Caravel User Project Features <https://youtu.be/zJhnmilXGPo>`__ -- What are the utilities provided by caravel to the user project ?
-  `Aboard Caravel <https://youtu.be/9QV8SDelURk>`__ -- How to put your design on Caravel? 
-  `Things to Clarify About Caravel <https://youtu.be/-LZ522mxXMw>`__ -- What versions to use with Caravel?

Check ``mpw-one-final`` for the caravel used for the mpw-one tapeout. 

Required Directory Structure
============================

-  ``gds/`` : includes all the gds files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``def`` : includes all the def files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``lef/`` : includes all the lef files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``mag/`` : includes all the mag files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``maglef`` : includes all the maglef files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``spi/lvs/`` : includes all the maglef files used or produced from the
   project.
-  ``verilog/dv`` : includes all the simulation test benches and how to
   run them.
-  ``verilog/gl/`` : includes all the synthesized/elaborated netlists.
-  ``verilog/rtl`` : includes all the Verilog RTLs and source files.
-  ``openlane/<macro>/`` : includes all configuration files used to
   run openlane on your project.
-  ``info.yaml``: includes all the info required in `this
   example <https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/master/info.yaml>`__. Please make sure that you are pointing to an
   elaborated caravel netlist as well as a synthesized
   gate-level-netlist for the user\_project\_wrapper


**NOTE:**

    If you're using openlane to harden your design, the ``verilog/gl`` ``def/`` ``lef/`` ``gds/`` ``mag`` ``maglef`` directories should
    be automatically populated.
